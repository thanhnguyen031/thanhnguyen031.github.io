        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>It all started with a simple idea: books should be more than just words on a page—they should be **felt, explored, and played with**. From that vision, Whimsical Walrus Wonders was born.</p>
        <p>We began crafting unique fidget books, blending **tactile experiences, secret compartments, and interactive storytelling** to bring joy to curious minds of all ages.</p>
